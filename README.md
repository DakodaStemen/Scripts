## Installation

### Step 1: Download the Scripts
Place both `WeeklyPCCheck.ps1` and `Setup-WeeklyTask.ps1` in the same folder (e.g., `C:\Projects\Scripts`).

### Step 2: Set Up the Scheduled Task

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**
   - Press `Win + X`
   - Select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" or "Terminal (Admin)"

2. **Navigate to the script folder**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Projects\Scripts
   ```

   ```powershell
   .\Setup-WeeklyTask.ps1
   ```

This will create a scheduled task that runs every Sunday at 10:00 AM.

## Manual Testing

To test the script immediately without waiting for the scheduled run:

```powershell
# Run as Administrator
.\WeeklyPCCheck.ps1
```

## Viewing Logs

All check results are saved in the `Logs` subfolder with timestamps:
- Location: `C:\Projects\Scripts\Logs\`
- Format: `PCCheck_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.log`

## Customization

3. Right-click and select "Properties"
4. Go to the "Triggers" tab
5. Edit the trigger to your preferred schedule
